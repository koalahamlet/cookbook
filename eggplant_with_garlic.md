11. 2 tbsp vinegar
12. 3 tbsp brown sugar
13. 0.50 tbsp ground bean sauce

### Equipment:

### Directions:
Step 1: Prepare & steam eggplant

Wash the eggplants and cut away the stem.
We'll  cut about 2 inch pieces along the length of the eggplant.
Starting with the tail (the side opposite from the stem), slice the pieces length-wise into  long pieces. Transfer the pieces to a dish for steaming later.
Steam or panfry the eggplant for 15 minutes.

Step 2: Cut vegetables

While we wait for the eggplant to steam for 15 minutes, we’ll start chopping our ingredients. 
We’ll be chopping our fresh shiitake mushrooms (56.7 g) and mini sweet peppers (3) into small chunks. Cut the tops off of the peppers, and remove the seeds from the center. 
We’ll also be mincing garlic (5 cloves), ginger (14.2 g), green onion (3 pieces), dried red chilies (2) and another sweet pepper into fine pieces. 

Step 3: Prepare Yuxiang sauce

- light soy sauce (2 tbsp)
- dark soy sauce (1 tbsp)
- oyster sauce (2 tbsp)
- vinegar (2 tbsp)
- brown sugar (3 tbsp)
- ground bean sauce (0.50 tbsp)
- cornstarch (2 tsp)
- water (4 tbsp)
- Shaoxing cooking wine (1 tbsp) 

Step 4: Finish steaming, start cooking

Remove the eggplants from steaming or frying.  Dry your pan, and reheat the pan on high heat for a few minutes until it’s around 300-350°F. 
Then, we’ll add about 2 tsp of corn oil and let that heat up until it’s shimmering, or forming ripples across the surface. 

- Add the minced chilies + peppers, ginger, garlic. Cook & stir for about 30-45 seconds to release the aromatics.
- Add the mushrooms. Optionally add some of the green onions. Cook & stir for about 20-30 seconds. 
- Add the sweet pepper chunks, Cook & stir for about 60 seconds, constantly stirring the wok. 
- Add the sauce, and cook until the sauce is boiling.
- Add and mix the eggplant around with the sauce for about 60-90 seconds.
- Add sesame oil (1 tsp) and stir.

Step 5: Plate & garnish

Transfer the dish onto a plate, garnish with the green onions, and call your loved ones over!
