# Dashi Maki Tamago

This dish is *all* about technique, as you'll note the scant ingredient list. You'll also notice that other recipes will have you individually add mirin, soy, and sugar to the mix. However, with a good mentsuyu you are able to sidestep all the individual tiny measurements.

### Equipment:
* any nonstick pan, but preferably a square tamago pan
* a medium fine mesh strainer
* chopsticks

  
### Ingredients:
* 4 eggs
* 1/4 cup dashi
* 1 tablespoon mentsuyu
* some amount of sugar?
* optionally add any pickles, se aweed salad, or really whatever you feel like adding, as long as it's relatively thin

  

Mix the eggs together well without adding too many bubbles. Then strain through a medium mesh specifically to remove the large whitish clear clumps that cannot be beaten into incorporation.

Once strained, add in the dashi, mentsuyu, and etc. Beat well to incorporate everything evently.

This next part should be learned from [visual demonstration](https://youtu.be/x4BDc6GPlTk?t=134) if it's your first time as it's the key to getting this dish right.

Oil the nonstick pan lightly and place on a medium high heat. Pour a thin layer of your egg mixture into the pan and allow it to cook until a thin layer is done. Use the chopsticks to pop any large air bubbles that form and to lightly lift the edges of the egg from the pan. Now raise the pan with your other hand and "flip" the egg onto itself forming several folds. Now you pour another layer of egg mixture into the pan and do the whole process again. Depending on the size of your pan you should be able to do this process 3 or 4 times.

Finally once you've build up your egg roll allow it to cook on either side for a minute more until it looks done. When the roll is "done" is very much a visual thing to learn. You'll see the eggs become bouncy and yellow. Now flip the roll onto a plate and cut it short ways so you're left with sashimi like slices of egg.
