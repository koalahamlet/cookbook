### Ingredients:
2 tomato (medium sized)
2 oz carrot
2 oz seafood mushroom
2 oz king oyster mushroom
3 piece shiitake mushroom
0.25 oz dried wood ear mushroom
2 egg
1 oz red bell pepper (half of a bell pepper, at the default serving size)
2 piece green onion
2 piece dried chili peppers (optional)
14 oz tofu (firm)
Other Flavors

5 cup water (for soup base)
2 tbsp vinegar
1 tsp white pepper
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp light soy sauce (Amazon​)
0.50 tbsp dark soy sauce (add more for a darker colored soup. Tamari works as a substitute - Amazon​ )
3 tbsp cornstarch
2 tbsp water (for cornstarch slurry)
sesame oil (to taste. Buy on Amazon​ )
1 tbsp corn oil

### Equipment:
* a large pot

### Directions:

Step 1: Chop tofu, mushrooms, veggies
seafood mushrooms (2 oz): cut away the roots, and cut the stems in half
king oyster mushrooms (2 oz): cut in little strips.
My dad only uses about half of one for this recipe, but feel free to use more.
shiitake mushrooms (3 piece): cut into thin slices
If you bought dried shiitake mushrooms, rehydrate them in warm water for 10 minutes
dried wood ear mushroom (0.25 oz): rehydrate in warm water for 10 minutes, then cut into thin slices
tofu (14 oz): cut into thin strips
carrots (2 oz): cut into thin strips
red bell peppers (1 oz): cut into thin strips
green onion (2 piece): mince
tomato (2 ): dice into small cubes

Step 2: Prepare cornstarch slurry and eggs
In a bowl, mix together cornstarch (3 tbsp) and water (2 tbsp)​ with a spoon until it becomes an even slurry.

In another bowl, crack eggs (2 ) and mix well.

For both of these, you'll need to mix them again later right before you pour them into the soup.

To save time for later, boil water (5 cup) in advance.

Step 3: Heat wok with oil, chili
Set the stove to its highest heat setting, and start to heat up the wok.

Add a little bit of corn oil (1 tbsp)​, as well as our dried chili peppers (2 piece).

We'll heat and toss the chilies around the oil for about 1 minute as our wok heats up. The purpose is to add more of a spicy essence to the oil.

Afterwards, we'll take the chilies out of the wok. We won't need them anymore.

Step 4: Add vegetables, flavors
Cook the diced tomatoes for 30-60 seconds, then add our boiled water (5 cup).

Next, we'll add white pepper (1 tsp) and stir for 15-30 seconds. It's important to add the white pepper before we thicken it with cornstarch, since it's much easier to mix the white pepper evenly across the soup base.

Then, we'll add salt (1 tsp), sugar (1 tbsp), light soy sauce (2 tbsp), and dark soy sauce (0.50 tbsp)​. If you prefer a darker look to your soup, you can add more dark soy sauce. Stir for 15-30 seconds.

And finally, we'll add our tofu, mushrooms, and vegetables (with the exception of green onion). Stir gently for 5-10 seconds.

Step 5: Cover pot, bring to boil

Cover the pot with a lid. My dad opted for a smaller lid, which is supposed to help the wok come to a boil more quickly.

Once it's boiling (in about 3-4 minutes), we'll add the rest of our flavors.

Step 6: Add cornstarch, egg, vinegar, sesame oil
Cornstarch slurry

Since the cornstarch has probably settled, mix it up again with a spoon, and slowly pour in the cornstarch over the course of 50-60 seconds. Stir constantly.

Eggs

Beat the eggs (2 ) again, and slowly pour in the eggs all around the wok, over the course of 20-30 seconds. Unlike Egg Flower Soup, we don't have to stir as we pour.

Vinegar, Sesame Oil

Add vinegar (2 tbsp) to the wok, as well as sesame oil (to taste).
