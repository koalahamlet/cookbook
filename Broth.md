# Broth
Fundamentally "broth" is just "delicious water." So if you think a thing is delicious, if you boil it in water, then you will have delicious water. It's also the secret to great cooking. 

 I remember first discovering this when I took dried shiitake mushrooms and after rehydrating them in water, I noticed that the water just tasted like shiitakes. 
This was then reinforced when I followed some Korean recipes and noticed they mostly start with making a broth. And what was that broth? It was the result of boiling water with dried fish, radish, seaweed, and green onions. 

Broth can come in many forms, chicken broth, beef broth, veggie broth, seafood broth. And the process is always the same. Take the thing, boil the thing in water with some other complimentary ingredients. Now use that water to flavor other things or just drink it on it's own. 

I think I like to emphasize this point because to the non-cook, making a broth can seem frightening, but it really is as simple as "put thing in water and boil" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFIa6I5lVrk
