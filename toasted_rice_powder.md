### Ingredients:
* Thai sticky rice
Optional additives
- lime zest
- thai chili powder
- garlic powder
- coriander powder
- dried shallots

### Equipment:
* Nonstick pan
* Mortar and pestle 

### Directions:
Take thai sticky rice and and place in a pan on medium heat. shake the rice to move it around once every 15 to 30 seconds. Wait until the rice takes on a light golden brown and begins to smell nutty. You'll know it's done because you'll smell a lovely nutty "toasted" flavor from the rice without smelling any "burning" or "burnt" smell.

Once done move the rice into the mortar and pestle. Grind into a semi fine powder. After you've ground everything, you can experiment with adding chili, lime zest, and etc to taste.

Store in a dry container for future larb salads.
