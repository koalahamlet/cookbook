INGREDIENTS
1 pound Chinese egg noodles (1/8-inch-thick), frozen or (preferably) fresh. (you can sub whatever noodles you want realistically, I just like egg noodles.)

2 tablespoons sesame oil, plus a splash

3 ½ tablespoons soy sauce

2 tablespoons Chinese rice vinegar

2 tablespoons Chinese sesame paste

1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter

1 tablespoon sugar or equivalent of agave nectar. 

1 tablespoon finely grated ginger

2 teaspoons minced garlic

2 teaspoons chili-garlic paste, or chili oil of your choosing. 
 Half a cucumber, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1/8-inch by 1/8-inch by 2-inch sticks

¼ cup chopped roasted peanuts

cilantro(optional)

PREPARATION
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook until barely tender, about 5 minutes; they should retain a hint of chewiness. Drain, rinse with cold water, drain again and toss with a splash of sesame oil.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons sesame oil, the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame paste, peanut butter, sugar, ginger, garlic and chili-garlic paste. If the sauce seems a little too viscous, add a tablespoon of water to make it a bit more runny. 

Saute noodles with sauce and additional peanuts in the pan for about 5 more minutes on high heat, until evenly warmed through. 

Plate and serve with your fresh cucumbers and cilantro if you like that sort of thing.
