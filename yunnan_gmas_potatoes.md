Optional: Garnish 1Tbsp Chili oil


### Equipment:

### Directions:
1. Peel the potatoes, then slice into roughly two inch cubes. Lay down in one layer on a plate. We’ll be steaming these, so make sure that your plate’s big enough to lay everything down without piling.
2. Steam potatoes for 20 minutes.  Get a pot or wok with a bit of water up to a boil. If you don’t have a  steaming rack, you can lay a couple chopsticks down in a wok to raise  things up, or macguiver a solution with some aluminum foil. Put the  plate on the rack, cover, and steam over high heat.
3. Mince the garlic, slice the scallions. If you’re using sauerkraut, mince it.
4. Take out the potato plate from the steamer. Just a quick word: make sure you keep the starch water on the plate.  Don’t drain anything, that water’ll go into the stir-fry together with the potatoes.
5. Stir-fry. As always when stir-frying, first longyau:  get your wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in your oil – here  about 2 tbsp – and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface. Toss  the flame to medium, then immediately:

- Garlic, in. Fry for ~15 seconds.
- White portion of the green onion, in. Super brief mix (~5 seconds)
- Pickled vegetable of choice, in. Super brief mix (~5 seconds)
- Chili powder, in. Combine and fry for about 15 seconds.
- Potato  together with its starchy steaming liquid, in. With you spatula begin  mashing the potatoes, stirring periodically. Fry for about a minute,  until the potatoes have come together a bit.
- Swirl  another tablespoon of oil around the wok and add in the salt. Continue  mashing for about 90 seconds. Why add some more oil here? Mostly because  you don’t want the potatoes to get dry and sticky. If at any point the  potatoes are really starting to stick on you, feel free to add in a  touch more oil. As for the salt, we added it here to give it time to mix  in.
- Once  the large chunks of potatoes are basically completely gone, add in the  Sichuan pepper powder and the scallion greens. Mix and mash for ~30  seconds.
- Heat off, out.

6. Optionally  drizzle your chili oil or the Laoganma on top, quantity depending on  your tastes. I personally like topping with about 2 tbsp of chili oil.
