* 1 onion medium onion
* 3 large carrots
* 1/2 box of japanese curry mix

* 1 medium to large potato
* 1 Tbsp honey
* 1 apple
* literally any leftover vegetables you want to use.
* Cheese

## Equipment

* A large pot


cut up your onions, carrots, potatoes, apples, and etc.

Brown the onions with some oil/butter and really take the time to brown some of them, this will give you a better overall flavor later. Next microwave your carrots and potatoes until they's lightly soft on the outside without being mushy(3-5 minutes depending on microwave power). Finally throw these in with your onions, soup stock,Â  apples, and curry cubes. Heat on medium high while stirring to incorporate the curry cubes.

Once blended, add in honey and butter/milk to taste.

Now let cook on a low boil for 10-15 minutes to reduce. 
Finally mask a slurry with the cornstarch and whisk into curry to thicken.

Serves best with Rice, some kind of katsu fried protein, and japanese pickles.
