## Ingredients
- soba
- shredded seaweed
* Dipping sauce
	- wasabi paste
	- chopped green onions
	- [[Mentsuyu]]


## Equipment
* A pot for boiling
* A colander for draining. 


### Directions:
Boil Soba to desired softness. 

Immediately rinse in cold water. Shake the soba till they're only lightly damp. 

In a small bowl, mix [[Mentsuyu]], chopped green onions, and grated wasabi to desired spiciness. This is the "dipping sauce"

Serve noodles with a mile of shredded nori ontop. Dip the noodles into the dipping sauce and slurp the noodles to enjoy the most fully. 
The slurp is necessary as it makes the spicy aromatics from the wasabi more potent.
