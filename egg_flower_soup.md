### Ingredients:
Soup Base
3 egg
1 tbsp water
6 cup water
3 tbsp cornstarch
5 tbsp water
Additional Ingredients

2 oz pea (frozen or canned is fine)
2 oz corn (frozen or canned is fine)
2 oz carrot
2 stalk green onion (optional, for garnish)
Flavor

1 tsp salt
1 tsp chicken bouillon
white pepper (to taste)
sesame oil (to taste)

### Equipment:

### Directions:
Step 1: Cut green onion, carrots
First, chop up some green onion (2 stalk) and carrots (2 oz). For the carrots, my dad prefers to chop them into little cubes.

Step 2: Boil water
Add water (6 cup) to your pot, and set the stove to high heat to bring the pot to a boil. Cover the pot with a lid.

Step 3: Prepare eggs
Now we build the foundation of our Egg Flower Soup.

Crack eggs (3 ) into a bowl, and add a small amount of water (1 tbsp). Then, mix with a fork or chopsticks for about 20 seconds.

Pro-tip:
The water helps the eggs "flower" more easily and beautifully.

Step 4: Add carrots, corn, peas, additional veggies
Once our pot is boiling, add carrots (2 oz), corn (2 oz), and peas (2 oz). Cover the pot again.

Step 5: Prepare cornstarch slurry

Add cornstarch (3 tbsp) and water (5 tbsp) to a bowl, and mix until there are no clumps left.

Over the course of about 30 seconds, gradually pour the cornstarch slurry into the soup, stirring the soup constantly as we pour.

Step 6: Slowly pour & mix eggs
Similar to the previous step, gradually pour in the eggs into the pot, constantly stirring as you go. Do this for about 20 seconds.

The slower you pour, the more wispy "flowers" you'll get. DO NOT pour the eggs all at once.

Step 8: Add flavors
Turn the heat off to preserve the softness of the eggs and avoid overcooking the soup.

Next, add salt (1 tsp) and chicken bouillon (1 tsp), as well as white pepper ( ) and sesame oil ( ) to your liking. Stir the flavors around for a few seconds.
