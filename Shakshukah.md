# Shakshukah
This is one of the "kitchen sink" dishes. Anything leftover or extra you have in the fridge can go into this curry and come out delicious. It's great for crowds or for a lazy weeknight dinner.


## Equipment
- A very large nonstick pan. 
- A vegetable peeler if you're including carrots.
- A kitchen torch (optional)

## Ingredients
- a 28oz can of tomatoes 
- eggs(4-5 but really however many you can reasonably fit in your cooking dish) 
- honey
- 1 medium onion(or shallots) 
- 1 carrot or roasted red peppers(optional)
- aromatic spices! 
	- 1-2 TBSP Home made [[Ras el Hanout]] 
	- 2-3 cloves of Garlic
- stewing spices
	- 1 TBSP paprika 
	- 1 tsp Cumin seeds
	- 1 Â½ tsp Harissa paste(if you like it spicy)
- Cheese(preferably something mild )
- optional: additional veggies! e.g. mushrooms, zucchini

### Directions:
Dice your onions and and sweat them in some oil or butter. After they begin to release their moisture, add in any extra chopped vegetables you have and then douse everything in your pile of spices. 

Allow this to mingle in the pan on medium heat for a few minutes so that the aromatic spices are toasted. 
Once the onions have absorbed spice and become reddish orange and a little more translucent, dump in the can of tomatoes. If it's a can of whole tomatoes, take this opportunity to break them up manually with your stirring implement. 

Add your stewing spices and allow the tomato mixture to simmer. 

If you have a carrot, take this opportunity to make thin carrot strips with your vegetable peeler and add them in to the tomatoes as they cook down. 

Keep simmering until the tomato mixture goes from liquidy to a stew like consistency. Using your stirring implement, make egg sized holes in the shaksukah. Crack your eggs into these holes. After adding your eggs, cover the pan with a lid and let them simmer for about 5 minutes. 

After this take to the table you'll be serving it on and lightly cover the top with your cheese. Either flame the cheese individually or cover with lid again to let the excess heat from the mixture and melt the cheese.
Sprinkle with either chopped cilantro or parsley and serve.
