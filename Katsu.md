^^ main recipe

  

Katsu sauce

1.  ▢ 2½ tsp Worcestershire sauce (I use Japanese brand Bull-Dog Worcestershire Sauce (Usuta-so-su, ウスターソース), which is **milder and less sour** than Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce. Please adjust to your taste)
    
2.  ▢ 1 Tbsp ketchup (Some ketchup is sweeter than others, so please adjust the amount of sugar, as desired)
    
3.  ▢ 1½ tsp [oyster sauce](https://www.justonecookbook.com/oyster-sauce/) (If you're allergic to shellfish, use Lee Kum Kee Vegetarian Stir-Fry Sauce)
    
4.  ▢ 1⅛ tsp sugar (Add more sugar, as desired)
