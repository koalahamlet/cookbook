### Ingredients:
1 pound black beans
24 ounces mixed, smoked sausages (see notes above) sliced
12 ounces "feijoada mix" or salt pork, optional
1 onion
3 cloves garlic
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon oil
Rice:
2 cups parboiled white rice
1-2 cubes chicken bouillon and 6 cups hot water
or 6 cups of chicken broth

Greens:
2 bunches collard greens
1 tablespoon oil
2 cloves garlic
1/2 teaspoon chicken bouillon
Garnish:
Farofa (toasted tapioca flour)
peeled, sliced oranges

### Equipment:

### Directions:
Soak the beans for 12 hours in enough water to cover them. Drain. Add to a large pot with about 8 cups water. Cover and bring to boil.

Meanwhile, start the rice. Put rice into a medium-large pot with bouillon and 4 cups of hot water. Bring to boil over high heat, then reduce to medium and let it simmer uncovered. Stir occasionally and add hot water as needed. Cook this way for about 15 minutes or until rice is tender. Let simmer 5 more minutes until the liquid has evaporated. Cover and set aside.

Once the beans have come to a boil, boil for 30-40 minutes or until softened. Add the meat. Cook another 30 minutes or until the beans are tender.

In a small pot, saute the onion, garlic and cilantro in the oil for a minute until the onion is fragrant. Add about a cup of the bean-cooking liquid and boil. Turn off heat and let cool.

Begin the collard greens. Wash and remove the stem from each leaf. Stack 4-5 leaves, roll them into a "cigar" and thinly slice to make chiffonade. Repeat with all the greens. Put into a large pot, cover with water, and bring to boil over high heat. Simmer for 20-30 minutes or until dark green.

Once the onion/bean water mix has cooled a little, puree it in the blender. Be careful blending hot liquids. Pour this back into the bean pot and stir. Cook the beans another 30-45 minutes or until the liquid has thickened and become cloudy as the beans break up.

Finish the collard greens: Drain cooked greens in a colander. Saute the garlic and bouillon in a little oil until golden and smelling good. Add greens and stir to coat them. Turn off heat and cover. Set aside.

When the beans are cooked, serve separate dishes of rice, greens, beans and meat so that everyone makes their own plate. Garnish with farofa and serve orange slices afterwards
