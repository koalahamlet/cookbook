# Oyakodon

To attempt to make oyakodon is to come closer to understanding the difference of food quality standards between countries. One of the keys to a good oyakodon is having a still runny white and yolk. This should make one raise their eyebrows knowing that one country can safely do that while another cannot.

-   ▢ 2 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
-   ▢ ½ onion (3 oz, 85 g)
-   ▢ 2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell)
    
-   ▢ ½ cup [dashi (Japanese soup stock; click to learn more)](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-dashi-jiru/) (using good, flavorful dashi is very important in this recipe!)
-   ▢ 1½ Tbsp [mirin](https://www.justonecookbook.com/mirin/)
-   ▢ 1½ Tbsp [sake](https://www.justonecookbook.com/sake/)  
-   ▢ 1½ Tbsp [soy sauce](https://www.justonecookbook.com/soy-sauce/)  
-   ▢ 1½ tsp sugar


### Directions:
1.  ▢ 2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice (1½ rice cooker cups (180 ml x 1.5 = 270 ml) yield roughly 2 donburi servings; see how to cook short-grain with a [rice cooker](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-rice/), a [pot over the stove](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-cook-rice/), an [Instant Pot](https://www.justonecookbook.com/instant-pot-rice/), or a [donabe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-cook-rice-in-donabe/))
    
2.  ▢ 2 sprigs [mitsuba (Japanese parsley)](https://www.justonecookbook.com/mitsuba/) (or green onion/scallion)
    
3.  ▢ [shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice)](https://www.justonecookbook.com/shichimi-togarashi/) (optional, if you like spicy)

Combine the dashi, mirin, sake, and soy sauce in a bowl or a liquid measuring cup.

Add the sugar and mix all together until the sugar is dissolved. Depending on the size of your frying pan, you may not need all the broth. You can keep the leftovers in the refrigerator for 3 days.
