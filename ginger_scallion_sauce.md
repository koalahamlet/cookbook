### Ingredients:
2 oz green onion
1.5 oz ginger
5 tbsp corn oil
1 tbsp sesame oil
2 tsp salt

### Equipment:


### Directions:
Step 1
We'll start by mincing our green onions (2 oz) and ginger (1.5 oz)â€‹.

For the green onions, we'll be using the white stems (about 4 stems at the default serving size). Cut each stem in half, length-wise, and then into strips. Then, mince the strips into fine pieces.

For the ginger, we'll be cutting them into thin slices, strips, and then fine pieces.

Step 2
We'll heat up our wok on high heat and add corn oil (5 tbsp).The oil should be around 350-400F before we add the ginger.

This is where my infrared thermometer really shines, but a good visual cue is to wait until the oil starts "shimmering", or forming ripples across the surface due to the heat.

Once the oil is hot enough, add the ginger and cook for about 15 seconds before adding the green onions. Cook everything for another 20-30 seconds before transferring the sauce to a bowl.

Step 3: Flavor the Sauce
We'll add salt and sesame oil (1 tbsp) to the bowl, and mix for 30-60 seconds.

Do a taste test. If it's not salty enough, feel free to add more.
