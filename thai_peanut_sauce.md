# Thai Peanut sauce


### Ingredients:
-   2 Tbsp red curry paste, panang curry paste, or massaman curry paste (each one will give a slightly different flavour)
-   1¼ cup coconut milk
-   ½ cup roasted peanuts
-   2 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds (or substitute 2 Tbsp more peanuts)
-   1-2 tsp fish sauce
-   2 Tbsp finely chopped palm sugar
-   2-3 Tbsp tamarind juice

### Equipment:

### Directions:
In a food processor, grind the peanuts into a  fine meal. If using sesame seeds, grind them into a fine meal using a  spice/coffee grinder or a mortar and pestle, being careful not to over  grind them into sesame butter.

In a small pot over medium heat, reduce ¼ cup  of the coconut milk by about half. Add curry paste and cook over medium  low heat, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes until it is very  thick. If it thickens too quickly, add a splash of coconut milk to help  loosen it up.

Stir in the rest of the coconut milk, ground  peanuts, ground sesame seeds (if using), fish sauce, palm sugar and  tamarind juice. Simmer for a few more minutes until it has thickened  into a dip consistency, stirring frequently to prevent the bottom from  scorching.

Taste and adjust seasoning with more sugar, fish sauce, and tamarind juice as needed.
